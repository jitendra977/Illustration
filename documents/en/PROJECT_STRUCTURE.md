## 📄 Configuration Files

-   `INSTALLATION.md` - **First-time setup guide.**
-   `SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Technical specification.
-   `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Local setup and contribution guide.

## 📝 Design Principles
1. **Cloud Native**: All configurations are parameterized via environment variables.
2. **Modular**: Frontend and Backend are decoupled and can scale independently.
3. **Security First**: Secrets are managed in `.env` files and never committed.
